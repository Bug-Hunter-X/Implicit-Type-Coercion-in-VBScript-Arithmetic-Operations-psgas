This repository demonstrates a common error in VBScript caused by implicit type coercion during arithmetic operations. The `bug.vbs` file shows the problematic code, while `bugSolution.vbs` presents a corrected version that explicitly handles data types, preventing unexpected results.  The error arises from the lack of explicit type declaration in function parameters, leading to potential type mismatch during calculations. This can result in incorrect values or runtime errors.
